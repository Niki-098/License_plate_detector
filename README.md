* Step 1: Gathering and Labeling a Custom Dataset
To train a custom object detector, you need a labeled dataset. You can acquire your dataset through one of two methods:

    * Method 1: Using Google's Open Images Dataset (RECOMMENDED)
      Gather a large dataset and auto-generate labels using Google's Open Images Dataset and the OIDv4 toolkit. This method is efficient and provides access to thousands of labeled images for over 600 classes.
    * Method 2: Manually Labeling Images with Annotation Tool
      Manually draw labels using an annotation tool. This method is suitable if you cannot find the desired images or classes in Google's Open Images Dataset.

* Step 2: Moving Your Custom Datasets Into Your Cloud VM
Upload your 'obj' (training) and 'test' (validation) datasets as zip files to your Google Drive and copy them to your cloud VM. This process will speed up dataset transfer.

* Step 3: Configuring Files for Training
Configure various files to train your custom detector:
    * i) Cfg File
      Edit the '.cfg' file according to your custom object detector requirements. Adjust parameters such as 'width,' 'height,' 'max_batches,' 'steps,' and 'filters' based on the number of classes you are training for.
    * ii) obj.names and obj.data
      Create 'obj.names' with one class name per line, matching your classes from the dataset generation step.
    * iii) Generating train.txt and test.txt
      Generate 'train.txt' and 'test.txt' files with relative image paths for training and validation datasets using provided scripts.

* Step 4: Download pre-trained weights for the convolutional layers
Download pre-trained weights ('yolov4.conv.137') for the convolutional layers. These weights enhance model accuracy and speed up convergence.

* Step 5: Train Your Custom Object Detector!
Train your custom YOLOv4 object detector using the provided command. Adjust the flags based on your specific requirements.

* Step 6: Checking the Mean Average Precision (mAP) of Your Model
Evaluate the model's accuracy by running mAP calculations on saved weights files. This step helps you select the most accurate weights for your model.

* Step 7: Run Your Custom Object Detector!!!
Now, your custom YOLOv4 object detector is ready for action. Test it on images or videos to detect the objects or classes you trained it for.
